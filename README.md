==================

Equestrian Eclipse - Fall of an Empire by Cobalt Studios


This is a README for all the team members that are working on our project.
Download the repository clone with ALL branches available. The "master" branch is the stable version of the game.
Do NOT work on the master branch nor commit changes to the master branch! Instead commit your changes to the Branch0.xx (z.B. Branch0.05), where all new features are brought in. Then they are fixed and the admin can merge them into the master.

To work on the game you select on GitHub the Branch0.xx. Then automaticly the latest files are downloaded to your computer.
After that you open the reposity folder (the "[...]project.gmx" file) with GameMaker: Studio.

Now you can work like usual in the game. After a significant change, feature, and so on please use this approach to avoid merge errors:

1. Check if any new downloads are available (do NOT download them right away)
2. If so then check on the GitHub website the changed files
3. If your changed files are untouched, then try to commit your changes and upload them
4. If your changed files were edited aswell then try to implement the changes given into your code and then upload
5. Make sure that you have a proper description and a proper title, don't be lazy


Thank you very much for your assistance!
McEdy, the Admin.
