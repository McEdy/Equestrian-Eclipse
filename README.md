==================

Equestrian Eclipse - Fall of an Empire by Cobalt Studios


This is a README for all the team members that are working on our project.
Download the repository clone with ALL branches available. The "master" branch is the stable version of the game.

Do NOT work on the master branch nor commit changes to the master branch! Instead commit your changes to the Branch0.xx (e.g. Branch0.05), where all new features are brought in.
Then they are fixed and the admin can merge them into the master.

To work on the game you select on GitHub the Branch0.xx. Then automaticly the latest files are downloaded to your computer.
After that you open the reposity folder (the "[...]project.gmx" file) with GameMaker: Studio.

Before you start working mind these steps:
1. Check if any new downloads are available
2. If yes: Download them; If not: Feel free to start coding

Now you can finally work on the game. After you have coded a new piece of the game you should commit your changes.
Best would be when you work on the game one day that you commit your changes this very day after you stop.

To commit your changes follow these steps:
1. Save your progress inside Game Maker
2. Open (if not already opened) GitHub
3. Make sure you are on the correct branch
4. Pick a proper name and a description for everything you have edited

The layout should be like that:

Added:
- xxx
Fixed:
- xxx
Bugs:
- xxx

5. Click commit changes button and after that the sync button
6. If there is a merge error contact the admin


Thank you very much for your assistance!
McEdy, the Admin.
