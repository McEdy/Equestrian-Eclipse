Equestrian Eclipse - Fall of an Empire by Cobalt Studios


This is a README for all the team members that are working on our project.
Just download the repository clone and then open it like a normal game folder in GameMaker: Studio
by selecting the .gmx file in the folder.

Now you can work like usual in the game. After a day or after a significant change
you can open your GitHub client and commit changes. Please make sure you find a proper name and describe what you did.
When you are ready to upload push the "Publish" button. Then all the files will be uploaded to the server.

The administrator will merge all changes to a master version.


Thanks very much for your assistance!
McEdy, the Administrator.
